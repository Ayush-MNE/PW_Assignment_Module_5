    "Ans. ### **Interpreting Coefficients in Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Linear Regression**, coefficients represent how much the dependent variable changes with a one-unit increase in an independent variable. However, **Logistic Regression is different** because it models probabilities using the **log-odds (logit) function**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Understanding the Coefficients**\n",
    "Each coefficient in Logistic Regression represents the **change in log-odds** for a one-unit increase in the corresponding feature, assuming all other features remain constant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Key Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- A **positive coefficient** means **higher probability** of the outcome (e.g., fraud, disease).  \n",
    "- A **negative coefficient** means **lower probability** of the outcome.  \n",
    "- A **zero coefficient** means **no effect**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Converting Log-Odds to Probability**\n",
    "Since coefficients are in **log-odds**, they are not directly interpretable in terms of probability. To make sense of them:  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Exponentiate the coefficient** → **Odds Ratio (OR)**  \n",
    "- \\( e^{\\beta} \\) tells us **how much the odds change** for a one-unit increase in the feature.  \n",
    "- If \\( e^{\\beta} > 1 \\), the feature **increases the likelihood** of the outcome.  \n",
    "- If \\( e^{\\beta} < 1 \\), the feature **decreases the likelihood** of the outcome.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example:**  \n",
    "- If **age coefficient = 0.5**, then **odds ratio** = \\( e^{0.5} \\approx 1.65 \\).  \n",
    "- This means **for each additional year of age, the odds of the event happening increase by 65%**.  \n",

    "| Feature | Coefficient (β) | Odds Ratio (e^β) | Interpretation |  \n",
    "|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|  \n",
    "| **Transaction Amount** | 0.8 | 2.23 | Higher amount **increases fraud odds by 123%** |  \n",
    "| **Time of Day (Night)** | -0.6 | 0.55 | Night transactions **reduce fraud odds by 45%** |  \n",
    "| **User Age** | 0.3 | 1.35 | Older users have **35% higher odds** of fraud |  \n",

    "✅ **Key Takeaway:** The model suggests **larger transactions are more likely fraudulent**, while **night transactions are less risky**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ Handling Continuous & Categorical Variables**\n",
    "- **Continuous variables**: Interpretation is straightforward (e.g., **one extra dollar increases fraud risk**).  \n",
    "- **Categorical variables**: One category is used as a **reference**, and other categories are compared against it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example:** If \"Payment Type\" has **Credit Card (reference), PayPal, and Bank Transfer**:  \n",
    "- If PayPal's coefficient is **1.2**, then **PayPal users are more likely to be involved in fraud than Credit Card users**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5️⃣ What If the Coefficients Are Hard to Interpret?**\n",
    "- **Scale variables**: Standardizing features makes interpretation easier.  \n",
    "- **Convert to probabilities**: Use **predictive probability plots** to understand impact.  \n",
