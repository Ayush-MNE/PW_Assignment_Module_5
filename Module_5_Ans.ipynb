    "Usage:\n",
    "Lists are typically used when the collection of items is expected to change (e.g., dynamic data).\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. Use Cases for Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Collections:\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed. This makes them ideal for storing data that should remain constant, like configuration settings or fixed collections of items such as coordinates in a 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Arguments:\n",
    "Tuples are commonly used to return multiple values from a function. They are also useful for passing a fixed collection of arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary Keys:\n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries. This is useful for representing composite keys, like grid coordinates or database primary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Data Structure:\n",
    "Tuples are suitable for representing fixed collections of items, such as days of the week, months of the year, or RGB color values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous Data:\n",
    "Tuples can store elements of different data types, making them useful for grouping related but different types of data, like a person's name, age, and occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases for Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique Elements:\n",
    "Sets are ideal for storing unique elements and automatically eliminating duplicates. This is useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership Testing:\n",
    "Sets provide efficient membership testing, making them useful for checking the existence of an element within a collection, such as ensuring a user is not added to a group twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set Operations:\n",
    "Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, making them useful for tasks that involve comparing and combining collections of data, such as finding common or distinct items between datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning:\n",
    "Sets are useful in data cleaning tasks to find and retain only unique values in a dataset, such as extracting unique words from a large text.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Tuples are best used for immutable collections, returning multiple values from functions, keys in dictionaries, fixed data structures, and grouping heterogeneous data.\n",
    "Sets are optimal for ensuring unique elements, efficient membership testing, performing set operations, data cleaning, and avoiding duplicate entries.\n",

    "8. Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. This requirement ensures that the keys are hashable, meaning that they have a fixed hash value for their entire lifetime, allowing for efficient retrieval. The immutability of dictionary keys is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of the dictionary. Here’s why immutable keys are important and an example to illustrate this concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for Immutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency:\n",
    "Immutable keys ensure that the key's hash value remains constant throughout its lifetime. This consistency is vital for the internal hash table mechanism used by dictionaries to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency:\n",
    "The hash table relies on the hash values of keys to index and look up values quickly. If keys were mutable, their hash values could change, leading to potential mismatches and inefficient lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrity:\n",
    "Using immutable keys prevents accidental changes to keys that could corrupt the dictionary's structure. This immutability guarantees the integrity of the data stored in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing:\n",
    "Immutable keys are hashable, which means they can be used as indices in the hash table. Hashable objects must have a constant hash value that does not change during their lifetime."
